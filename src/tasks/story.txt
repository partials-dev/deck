Welcome to Listener! This is a swipe-based adventure game made by Partials! You can basically think of it as Tinder-Zelda. ;)

You can make decisions or respond to dialog by swiping right or left. Drag the card to each side to see what each direction does. Read carefully...

You can also swipe the card down to backtrack, and eventually pulling the card up will reveal an important tool.

Well look at you. I didn't think I'd ever see another biped be able to move again. After the great silence, i assumed everyone had frozen where they were. Statues to be gawked at in the distant future....

But what a welcomed surprise you are! And especially in your condition. Breathing, Moving! You've got it all! Just try not to let it get to your head. I've got no use for a egotist!

There is a structure further in the forest that once filled the air with beautiful music for miles. But it hasn't made so much as a peep in ages. The air has gotten stale and the relative silence has had just made everyone so uninspired we're all practically useless. You need to go in there and fix it!

I'm so glad you're willing to help! Oh and take this helix horn! It's a little creepy in there and there is nothing like a little music to ease the tension of an unsettling atmosphere.

You're not sure if what you're looking at is a building, a giant, or a musical instrument but there "is" a door in front of you.

More creaking and hissing. You also notice a low, ominous hum coming from the door to the right.

Thank you for getting my air flow back together in a reasonable way! Now I can move this big lumbering mass to start pumping out sounds to all of the forest. I can't imagine how long it's been since anyone heard this song last. Take a listen and pick out a few notes yourself!
